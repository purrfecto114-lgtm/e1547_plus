## Localization

The app interface is available in English, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Japanese and Russian, selectable on the first-launch welcome screen or in the settings at any time.

To add another language, create an `app_<locale>.arb` file in `lib/l10n` with translations for every key of `app_en.arb`, add the language to `appLanguages` in `lib/settings/data/language.dart`, and run `flutter gen-l10n` — the language picker and onboarding step pick it up automatically.

## Download

APK and IPA files can be found over at
the [releases](https://github.com/clynamic/e1547/releases/latest).

A great tool for managing updates for this app is [obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) (see [Using Obtainium](#Using-Obtainium) for a more detailed guide).

You can also find the app on the Google PlayStore:

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.e1547">
    <img src="https://github.com/steverichey/google-play-badge-svg/blob/266d2b2df26f10d3c00b8129a0bd9f6da6b19f00/img/en_get.svg" width="30%"/>
</a>

### Certificate Fingerprints

To verify the authenticity of downloaded APK files, you can check the signing certificate fingerprints:

- **SHA1:** `8B:4B:8C:D7:FF:D6:04:DB:36:69:1B:D2:1A:BD:0E:54:0A:95:C8:28`
- **SHA256:** `8D:32:4E:43:4B:97:5A:A3:38:A7:A9:C7:F3:07:7E:1F:C0:DB:F1:30:3E:C5:D9:B9:63:4F:E8:3E:9D:DB:63:80`

via a tool like [AppVerifier](https://github.com/soupslurpr/AppVerifier).

## Installation

### Installing on Android

- Install through the [Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.e1547)

or

1. Download the [latest APK](https://github.com/clynamic/e1547/releases/latest)
2. Open it on your Android device with a file manager
3. Click install

#### Using Obtainium

1. Install and open obtainium from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dev.imranr.obtainium.fdroid/) or from their [Github](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium)
2. Click on "Add app" on the bottom app drawer
3. Paste https://github.com/clynamic/e1547/releases/ into the "App source URL*" field
4. Hit the add button, next to the App source URL field
5. Hit the install button in the following menu

#### Which APK should I download?

- Phone with 64 bit support (almost all phones from 2016 onwards) -> `e1547-arm64.apk`
- 32 bit only phone -> `e1547-armv7.apk`
- Doesn't work? -> `e1547-universal.apk`

Prefer the arm64 build whenever your device supports it: 32 bit processes
have a much smaller memory limit, which makes the app far more likely to
be killed by the OS on old, low memory devices.

### Installing on iOS

The app is not available in the AppStore.

- Follow the instructions on [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/)

or

- Jailbreak your device and install the [IPA](https://github.com/clragon/clynamic/releases/latest) directly

## Compilation

You can compile the app from source:

1. Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. Clone this github repository
3. Run `flutter build <file>` where `<file>` is either `apk` or `ipa`

## Status

Is the app currently under development?

The project is currently under limited support. I no longer have as much time to develop this project as I used to.

This is a passion project. If you enjoy using it, I am glad you do!
